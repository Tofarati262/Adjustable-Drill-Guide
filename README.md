## ðŸ”§ Problem
Traditional drilling setups rely on improvised jigs or manual alignment â†’ leading to inconsistent hole placement, wasted material, and limited adaptability.

---

## ðŸš€ Approach
- Designed modular system in CAD with parametric constraints  
- Integrated **angle adjustment (0Â°â€“90Â°)** and **depth control**  
- Developed **interchangeable bushing system** for multiple drill sizes    
- Prototyped using machined aluminum + 3D-printed parts  

---

## âœ… Results
- Accurate, repeatable drilling with reduced scrap rate  
- Fast angle adjustments without complex setup  
- Portable, low-cost alternative to fixed jigs  
- Improved operator ergonomics and usability  

---

## ðŸ“š Learned
- CAD modeling, tolerance stack-up
- Rapid prototyping with machining + additive manufacturing  
- User-centered design in mechanical tooling  
- Balancing precision engineering with manufacturability
